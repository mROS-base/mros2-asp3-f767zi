# mturtle_teleop

This is a sample application along with [mturtlesim](https://github.com/mROS-base/ros_tutorials/tree/mros2/foxy-devel/mturtlesim) (mros2 version).

The mROS 2 node on the embedded board publishes `Twist` (`geometry_msgs::msg::Twist`) message to `/turtle1/cmd_vel` topic, according to the input from keyboard via serial console.

## Generate header files for Twist

See detail in [<repo_root>/README.md#generating-header-files-for-custom-msgtypes](../README.md#generating-header-files-for-custom-msgtypes).

## Build and Run for embedded devices

Make sure to set `app=mturtle_teleop` as `make` option.

```
$ pwd
<snip.>/mros2-asp3-f767zi/workspace
$ make app=mturtle_teleop

Copying binary to the board...

### The above message is appeared if the board is already connected to host PC.
### If not, please connect the board and copy the binary manually.
$ cp asp.bin /media/$USER/NODE_F767ZI/
```

## Host operation for native ROS 2

Since the current version of does not support the QoS control, the original version of `mturtlesim` could not work well with this application. So please use the following repository (that is customized for mros2) to clone repository and build package.

```
$ cd <your_ros2_ws>/src
$ git clone -b mros2/foxy-devel https://github.com/mROS-base/ros_tutorials
$ cd ..
$ colcon build --packages-select mturtlesim
$ source install/local_setup.bash
```

## Expected output

### serial console for the baord with mros2

```
